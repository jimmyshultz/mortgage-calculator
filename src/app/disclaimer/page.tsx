              <h2>Calculation Accuracy</h2>
              <p>
                While we strive for accuracy in our calculators and tools, the results provided are estimates only. The actual terms of any mortgage, including but not limited to interest rates, fees, closing costs, and qualification requirements, will be determined by lenders based on various factors including:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Your credit score and history</li>
                <li>Your income and employment status</li>
                <li>Current market conditions</li>
                <li>The specific lender&apos;s policies and products</li>
                <li>Property location and type</li>
                <li>Down payment amount</li>
                <li>Loan-to-value ratio</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                The calculations do not account for all possible fees, taxes, or costs associated with obtaining a mortgage or purchasing a home. These may include property taxes, insurance, HOA fees, closing costs, and other expenses that can significantly affect the total cost of homeownership.
