              <p className="mb-4">
                Your credit score is one of the most important factors lenders consider when you apply for a mortgage. A higher score not only increases your chances of approval but can also help you secure a better interest rate, potentially saving you thousands of dollars over the life of your loan.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                For example, the difference between a "good" credit score (670-739) and an "excellent" score (740+) could mean a 0.5% difference in your interest rate. On a $300,000 mortgage over 30 years, that's a savings of around $30,000!

                  <li><strong>Fair (580-669):</strong> May qualify for FHA loans with higher down payment</li>
                  <li><strong>Poor (below 580):</strong> Difficult to qualify; may need substantial down payment or co-signer</li>

              <p className="mb-4">
                One of the most effective ways to quickly boost your credit score is to reduce your credit utilization ratio—the percentage of your available credit that you're currently using. This factor accounts for about 30% of your FICO score.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                Aim to get your credit card balances below 30% of your credit limits, with lower being even better. If possible, try to get them below 10% for the maximum positive impact on your score.
              </p>
              <div className="border-l-4 border-green-500 pl-4 py-2 mb-6">
                <p className="italic text-gray-700">
                  <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Even if you can't pay your balances completely, make larger-than-minimum payments to show lenders you're actively reducing debt.
                </p>
              </div>
              <p className="mb-4">
                If you have multiple credit cards with balances, focus first on cards that are close to their limits, even if they have smaller balances than other cards. This can have a more immediate positive impact on your score.

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Strategy 2: Avoid New Credit Applications</h2>
              <p className="mb-4">
                In the months leading up to your mortgage application, avoid applying for new credit cards, auto loans, or other forms of credit. Each application typically results in a hard inquiry on your credit report, which can temporarily lower your score by a few points.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                Multiple inquiries in a short period can signal financial distress to lenders, making you appear riskier. As a general rule, avoid new credit applications for at least six months before applying for a mortgage.
              </p>
              <div className="bg-yellow-50 p-6 rounded-lg my-6">
                <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-yellow-800 mb-2">Important Exception</h3>
                <p className="text-gray-700">
                  When you're rate-shopping for a mortgage, multiple inquiries for the same type of loan within a 14-45 day period (depending on the scoring model) are typically counted as a single inquiry, minimizing the impact on your score.

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Strategy 3: Check and Dispute Credit Report Errors</h2>
              <p className="mb-4">
                Studies show that about 25% of credit reports contain errors that could negatively impact scores. Review your credit reports from all three major bureaus (Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion) and look for inaccuracies such as:
              </p>
              <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
                <li>Accounts that don't belong to you</li>
                <li>Late payments reported incorrectly</li>
                <li>Incorrect credit limits or loan amounts</li>
                <li>Accounts incorrectly shown as open when they're closed</li>
                <li>The same debt listed multiple times</li>
              </ul>
              <p className="mb-4">
                If you find errors, dispute them directly with the credit bureau. By law, they must investigate and respond within 30 days. Request that corrected reports be sent to any lender who received your report in the last six months.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                You can get a free copy of your credit report from each bureau once a year at <a href="https://www.annualcreditreport.com" className="text-blue-600 hover:underline" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AnnualCreditReport.com</a>.

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Strategy 4: Become an Authorized User</h2>
              <p className="mb-4">
                If you have a trusted family member or close friend with excellent credit, ask them to add you as an authorized user on one of their older, well-managed credit card accounts. This can be particularly helpful if you have a limited credit history.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                When you become an authorized user, the account's payment history often appears on your credit report, potentially boosting your score. The ideal account would be one with:
              </p>
              <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
                <li>Perfect payment history</li>
                <li>Low balance relative to the credit limit</li>
                <li>Long history (several years old)</li>
              </ul>
              <div className="border-l-4 border-red-500 pl-4 py-2 mb-6">
                <p className="italic text-gray-700">
                  <strong>Warning:</strong> This strategy requires significant trust. Both parties should understand their responsibilities, as any negative account activity will affect both the primary user's and authorized user's credit scores.
                </p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Strategy 5: Make All Payments On Time</h2>
              <p className="mb-4">
                Payment history is the single most important factor in your credit score, accounting for about 35% of your FICO score. Even one late payment can significantly impact your credit score, and the effect can last for up to seven years.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                Set up automatic payments for at least the minimum amount due on all your credit accounts to ensure you never miss a payment. Also, consider setting up payment reminders or scheduling all bill payments around the same time each month to make them easier to manage.
              </p>
              <div className="bg-blue-50 p-6 rounded-lg my-6">
                <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-blue-800 mb-2">Beyond Credit Cards</h3>
                <p className="text-gray-700">
                  Remember that on-time payments for other obligations like rent, utilities, and phone bills can also help your credit score if they're reported to credit bureaus. Services like Experian Boost or tools through your bank may allow you to get credit for these payments.
