              <p className="mb-4">
                The housing market has been on a rollercoaster ride over the past few years. After the pandemic-fueled buying frenzy that saw record-low inventory and skyrocketing prices, the market has begun to stabilize, albeit with significant challenges for both buyers and sellers.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                Today's market is characterized by higher mortgage rates than we've seen in over a decade, gradually improving inventory levels, and a slowdown in the pace of home price appreciation. These factors have created a more balanced market than during the height of the pandemic, but one that still presents unique challenges.

                Perhaps no single factor has impacted the housing market more significantly than the rise in mortgage interest rates. After reaching historic lows during the pandemic (with 30-year fixed rates below 3%), rates have more than doubled, dramatically affecting affordability.

                The rate environment has created a "lock-in effect" where many homeowners with sub-4% mortgage rates are reluctant to sell and take on a new mortgage at today's higher rates. This has contributed to inventory shortages in many markets.

                  <strong>Expert Insight:</strong> Most economists project that mortgage rates will remain elevated compared to the 2010s but may gradually decrease if inflation continues to moderate. Few expect a return to the ultra-low rates seen during the pandemic.

              <p className="mb-4">
                Despite higher mortgage rates, which many predicted would cause significant price corrections, home values have proven remarkably resilient. After the explosive growth of 2020-2022, when many markets saw 20%+ annual appreciation, prices have largely stabilized with modest growth continuing in most areas.

                New construction has ramped up to help address the shortage, but builders face ongoing challenges:

                <li><strong>Higher construction costs</strong> - up 30-40% since pre-pandemic</li>

                <li><strong>Adjust expectations</strong> to the current affordability reality</li>
                <li><strong>Get fully pre-approved</strong> before house hunting</li>
                <li><strong>Consider assumable mortgages</strong> (particularly VA and FHA loans)</li>
                <li><strong>Explore seller concessions</strong> for rate buydowns or closing costs</li>
                <li><strong>Widen your geographic search</strong> to include emerging areas</li>
                <li><strong>Be ready to act quickly</strong> on desirable properties</li>
