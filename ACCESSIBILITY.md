# Accessibility Implementation

This document outlines the accessibility features implemented on TheMortgageEstimator.com to ensure compliance with accessibility standards and a better user experience for all visitors.

## Implemented Features

### Navigation and Structure

- **Skip to Content Link**: Allows keyboard users to bypass navigation and jump directly to main content
- **Semantic HTML**: Using proper heading structure (h1, h2, h3, etc.) and semantic elements like `<nav>`, `<article>`, `<section>`
- **Accessible Navigation**: Navigation menus include proper ARIA attributes and keyboard support
- **Properly Structured Breadcrumbs**: Using ARIA attributes to indicate the current page in breadcrumb navigation

### Components

- **Accessible Mobile Navigation**: Mobile menu with proper ARIA attributes and keyboard support
- **AccessibleImage Component**: Ensures all images have proper alt text and fallback options
- **AdBanner Accessibility**: Ad banners include proper ARIA roles and labels to ensure screen reader compatibility

### Forms and Interactivity

- **Keyboard Navigation**: Interactive elements can be accessed and operated using keyboard-only navigation
- **ARIA Attributes**: Added appropriate ARIA attributes to interactive components
- **Focus Management**: Improved visible focus states for better keyboard navigation

### Content

- **Color Contrast**: Ensuring sufficient contrast between text and background colors
- **Descriptive Link Text**: Links have descriptive text and ARIA labels where needed
- **External Links**: External links include proper attributes (`rel="noopener noreferrer"` and notifications for new windows)

## Recommendations for Full Compliance

To ensure full compliance with accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 AA), we recommend implementing the following additional features:

### Content and Structure

1. **Add more detailed alt text to images**: Ensure all images have descriptive alt text that conveys the purpose and content of the image.
2. **Review heading structure**: Ensure all pages follow a logical heading structure (H1 → H2 → H3).
3. **Implement aria-live regions**: For dynamic content updates, such as calculator results.

### Interactive Elements

1. **Enhance form validation**: Add clear error messages and ARIA attributes for form validation errors.
2. **Improve focus management**: Ensure focus is properly managed when dialogs open/close.
3. **Test keyboard navigation**: Ensure all interactive elements can be accessed and operated using keyboard only.

### Technical Compliance

1. **Implement proper page titles**: Ensure each page has a unique and descriptive title.
2. **Add language attributes**: Add `lang` attribute to HTML element.
3. **Test with screen readers**: Verify content is properly announced by screen readers (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver).

### Regular Testing

1. **Automated testing**: Use tools like Axe, WAVE, or Lighthouse to perform automated accessibility testing.
2. **Manual testing**: Perform keyboard-only navigation testing and screen reader testing.
3. **User testing**: If possible, conduct testing with users who rely on assistive technologies.

## AdSense Specific Accessibility Requirements

Google AdSense requires websites to meet basic accessibility standards to provide a good user experience. This includes:

1. **Accessible content**: Content should be readable and navigable for all users.
2. **Proper contrast**: Text should have sufficient contrast against backgrounds.
3. **Keyboard accessibility**: All interactive elements should be accessible via keyboard.
4. **Screen reader compatibility**: Content should be properly structured for screen readers.

Ensuring your site meets these accessibility requirements will not only help with AdSense verification but also improve user experience and potentially SEO rankings.
