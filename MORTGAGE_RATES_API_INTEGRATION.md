## Accessing Your Mortgage Rates Page

Your new page is available at: **`/mortgage-rates`**

The page is accessible through:
- Navigation menu (desktop and mobile)
- Direct URL: `yoursite.com/mortgage-rates`

## How to Integrate Real APIs

### Option 1: API Ninjas (Recommended - Free Tier Available)

1. **Sign up** at [https://api.api-ninjas.com/](https://api.api-ninjas.com/)
2. **Get your free API key** (1000 requests/month free)
3. **Add to environment variables**:
   ```bash
   # In your .env.local file
   MORTGAGE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```
4. **Uncomment the alternative implementation** in `/src/app/api/mortgage-rates/route.ts`

### Option 2: Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED)

1. **Get a free API key** at [https://fred.stlouisfed.org/docs/api/api_key.html](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/docs/api/api_key.html)
2. **Update the API route** to use your key instead of 'demo'
3. **Benefits**: Official government data, highly reliable

### Option 3: Mortgage Rate Widgets (Easiest)

1. **MortgageCalculator.org Widget**:
   - Visit: [https://www.mortgagecalculator.org/rates-widgets/mortgages/](https://www.mortgagecalculator.org/rates-widgets/mortgages/)
   - Copy the embed code
   - Add to your mortgage rates page

2. **ERATE.com Widget**:
   - Visit: [https://www.erate.com/widgets/rates-table-widget](https://www.erate.com/widgets/rates-table-widget)
   - Customize and copy the code
   - Embed in your page

## Current API Structure

Your API endpoint (`/api/mortgage-rates`) returns:

```json
{
  "lastUpdated": "Thursday, September 11, 2025",
  "source": "Market-Based Estimates (Updated Daily)",
  "nationalAverage": [
    {
      "loanType": "30-Year Fixed",

      "apr": "7.325",
      "points": "0.8",
      "change": "+0.015"
    }
    // ... more loan types
  ]
}
```

## Need Help?

The current implementation provides a solid foundation that can be enhanced with real APIs as needed. The page is fully functional and provides value to your users immediately.

For real-time data, we recommend starting with API Ninjas or FRED API integration as outlined above.
